#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iphone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM JanSales
WHERE product = 'iPhone'
AND LENGTH(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM customers
INNER JOIN FebSales
ON customers.order_id= FebSales.orderID
WHERE LENGTH(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT product
, price
FROM JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT MIN(price) FROM JanSales)
AND LENGTH(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product
, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM JanSales
GROUP By product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(quantity)
, product
, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum)
, AVG(quantity*price)
FROM FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN customers cust
ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE feb.quantity >2
AND LENGTH(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
